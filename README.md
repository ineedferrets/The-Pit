# The Pit
Developed during Ludum Dare 48, The Pit is an online party game where you must compete with your friends to dig out the treasure at the bottom of the map. You can download and play the game [here](https://carlosgonzalez.itch.io/the-pit)!

## Networking
This game utilises Normcore for it's networking.

## Further Improvements
The code is a bit of a mess and requires some TLC. Since we're all PhD students, we're hoping to get back to it when we have time!
